# MyReads Project

This is a web application to keep a track on your Book Reading List.
A Book can be placed in any of the tree buckets:Currently Reading, Want to read, Read.

## TL;DR

To start the application:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
